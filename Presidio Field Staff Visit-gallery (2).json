Land of Opportunity is a map that documents forty-three of the most well-documented toxic sites in the Bay Area, alongside local environmental justice protests and both federal and community-based remediation efforts. The tar-like blobs dripping down the paper are places notable for the amount of toxic material that has leaked into the soil and groundwater primarily as a result of high-tech industry, military activities, mercury mining during the gold rush era, and nuclear testing in the South Pacific during World War II. Despite its reputation for being one of the ‘greenest’ places in the United States, the Bay Area also has one of the highest concentrations of Superfund sites in the country, particularly in Silicon Valley, the techno-utopian capital of the United States. The map emphasizes community-based, grassroots organizing efforts, and shows both the kinds of poisons that have contaminated the land as well as the ways in which surrounding communities have protested the presence of these polluters and demanded their right to a clean, healthy environment. Land of Opportunity is a register of the ways in which the Bay Area has been shaped — both figuratively and literally — by dominant settler narratives of the landscape’s potential for wealth and resource extraction. But it is also more than the shadowland of settler, entrepreneurial greed, or the American imperial war machine: it’s also a place constituted and nourished by strong radical politics, care for community, and a trust in the power of local organizing. We live in a place of endless possibility — where the byproducts of greed and warmongering can be sublimated into other forms of power, and politics can be shaped in certain places by the will of the people.\" Connie Zheng, 2022 https://www.conniezheng.com"

It also has quite an extensive 'Table of Distances' added at the right of the inset.\" This is the second 1849 edition, which was also produced as a wall map (see our #4312). In this edition Fremont's route is shown along the Humboldt River, and California has been extensively remapped. Map is in full color and folds into the original blind-stamped covers, 16x11, with the title \"Colton's Map of the United States Mexico &c.\" in gilt on the front cover."

Numerous small drawings on the map of each state depict sights, people, activities, crops, animals, relief, populated places,etc. A product of the 1930s, it depicts stereotypical images of people, such as on the Tennessee map there are a Ku Klux Klan (KKK) member in white hood and robe with a pistol and a bucket of tar, and a black person dragging a sack of cotton. In addition to these sometimes offensive images, it also reflects the times in terms of what was important or noteworthy about each area of each state be it growing corn, raising mules, crabbing, racing horses, making movies, sailing, Native Americans, national parks, quilting, romance, volcanoes, whales, rain, gold, or big trees.
